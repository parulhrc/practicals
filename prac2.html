1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay State, which had existed since
1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking Gujarat.
Thus Maharashtra is a Marathi linguistic state. The state is divided into 6
divisions and 36 districts, with the state capital being Mumbai, also the most
populous urban area in India and Nagpur serving as the winter capital.
The Godavari and the Krishna are the two major rivers in the state.

of the state. The forest cover in the state is 16.47% of the state's
geographical area. Out of total cultivable land in Maharashtra about 60% land
is under food grain crops with Jowar (Sorghum bicolor) being the dominating crop.
